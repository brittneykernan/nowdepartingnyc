### First Impression

When you think Celebrity Cruise, first you laugh at the emotional branding aimed to stimulate the [human desire](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/05/150506094925.htm) to improve one's social status. (And if your husband is a skater like mine, you may also fondly think of [Celebrity Blue](https://itemlabel.com/products/peepy-celebrity-blue)). Then, after you're pleased with yourself for not being fooled, you may think this cruise could be nice. Celebrity's reputation is a bit more high-end than Carnival or Royal Carribean. This I can confirm. I've been on many of the cheapest Carnival and Royal Carribean cruises, so the bar was low. Celebrity's food was better. The decor had more attention to detail and construction was of higher quality. But I was still fooled. And I greived the loss of my undeceivable self. Below are the 5 stages of grief one can experience cruising a Celebrity Cruise and the 5 things I wish I knew before embarking.

### Phase 1: Denial. This cannot be in the app...

But it is. Download the Celebrity Cruises App. The information is actually helpful, scheduling is useful, and the animations are charming.

But some UX decisions, the ones addressed below and at the time of writing this, almost seem dubious.

#### How to Find the Security Briefing Videos

I work in app design, and I had to _ask a stranger_ for help to find this feature in the app.

Once you've signed ino your account, a bottom bar will appear in the app. The secret is that this bar is scrollable horizontally! There are no visual indicators to horizontal scrollability. Drag the bar to the left to reveal the right hidden items. Your Security Briefing button will be there with a life-vest icon.

#### How to Contact Your Friends Without Internet

There is no cell service on the sea. There is free Wi-Fi, but only to use the app. The cost of the Internet Package is untenable (see stage 4). So how do you contact your friends? Use a telephone to call their rooms? Ew, no. They probably won't be there anyway, and there is quite a lot to do onboard.

Once you're connected to the ship's Wi-Fi, you can invite your friends to chat. At the top right corner of the app is a speach bubble icon. Select that, and you can look up your friends by their name. Friends must accept your invite to chat before you can message them.

We didn't see our buddies for the whole first day because of this unmentioned-in-onboarding-materials feature.

### Phase 2: Anger. How am I supposed to sleep through this...

Sleeping as a millenial is challenging anyway, but here's what you need to do to sleep on a Celebrity Cruise.

#### Ambian

If you have a fear of flying or a fear of giant waves on the ocean, don't let anyone make you feel guilty about packing your sedatives. Pop one before bed. You never know when you'll hit a rough patch at sea.

#### Avoid Dessert

If you have a caffiene intolerance, I'm sorry, but you must skip those beautiful chocolate desserts. The dark chocolate is Rich, and high in caffiene.

I didn't realize this until day 3, of no sleep, which contributed to my aquisition of what I call the 'Celebrity Flu'.

#### Settle Your Clickers and Clackers

What does this mean? Anything that could make noise in the middle of the night from the movement of the ocean, will make noise. And you'll be too tired to do anything about it. Take those hangers out of the closet, and put them in a towel on the floor before you go to bed.

### Phase 3: Bargaining. The Up Sell is Real

The cruise is one big check-out line. This one I can't blame any cruise line for post-pandemic. But this is not a luxury experience.

#### Say No to the Drink Package

If you don't drink alcohol, the drink package is not worth it. If you travel as a couple, Both people have to purchase the package, so you can't scam off your pal's package.

#### Say No to the Internet Package

Unless you really need it. You can get cell service at the ports.

#### Say Yes to a reservation at QSine

This projection mapped dining experience was so charming.

#### Say No to the Spa Upgrades

#### Say Maybe to the Room upgrade
