A travel guide for [Barcelona, Spain](/barcelona)

# What to Wear in Barcelona In September

First off, Barcelona is a stylish place. You're going to want to leave your inclination to blend in at home. Stop scouring TikTok for European vacation fits and boldly do you like Barcelona does it (unless, of course, blending in is your thing, no judgment).

Before I fully realized this by strolling [La Rambla](https://shopstyle.it/l/b6gVy), I reached out to my beautiful Barcelonean friend Tatiana for style guidance:

> "honestly, the style is just as eclectic as in brooklyn just more â€¦ euro? i would say, pack what makes you feel cool and fit and you'll look ðŸ”¥." - [Tatiana Peck](#)

Also importantly, the weather in September supports great outfits and hair days. With highs in the high 70s and lows in the high 60s, you won't be too hot or too cold. Chances of rain are low, but possible.

### Tops
Sophisticated and sexy tops. I purchased 2 perfect ones while there from [Stradivarius](https://www.stradivarius.com/). A gilded white ribbed knit halter and a black see-through sleeveless ruched top.

### Bottoms
A pair of wide-leg trousers will mix great with flirty or elegant tops. I brought an off-white high-waisted second-hand [Zara](https://www.zara.com/us/) pair. I also packed a below-the-knee silk [Aritzia](https://www.aritzia.com/us/en/home) black skirt. Both of these will keep you cool in the sun, and ready for going out.

### Shoes
Bring stylish and comfortable walking shoes. I opted for second-hand tan tassel loafers with ankle socks over branded sneakers, to not scream 'United Statesian', but folks were wearing bold sneakers. We walked an average of 8 miles a day, so break any new shoes in before you go.

### Jacket & Sweater
Bring a lightweight cool Jacket. Oversized blazers were in, so I brought a black one from [ASOS](https://shopstyle.it/l/b6gVh) and a thrifted white crocheted loose sweater.

### Hat 
You can wear your US baseball caps here and out yourself as a foreigner because they are trending. I purchased a felt hot-pink baseball cap at [Parfois](https://www.parfois.com/en/us/home/) because I mistakenly left my must-have sun protection at home. 

### Shall
For visiting cathedrals and sacred sites. FYI, you'll want to cover your shoulders, midriff, and thighs. 

### Beach Attire
Flip flops, a coverup, a bikini, and sun protection. 

### Purse 
A cross-body purse is always best in a new city, but I used a tote bag to fit my [DK Eyewitness travel guide](https://www.amazon.com/Eyewitness-Barcelona-Catalonia-Travel-Guide/dp/0241559359/ref=asc_df_0241559359/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=564700937500&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=7659904418129715150&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9004347&amp;hvtargid=pla-1464207638093&amp;psc=1&amp;mcid=76461bf46d9a3c78b01bb7525f02f1c0&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA-bmsBhAGEiwAoaQNmpcCvVR_0VPx0lyWtatPIg3EvN6sASqVRW5I5XyBRb9jKIngUasW2xoC1IUQAvD_BwE&_encoding=UTF8&tag=nowdepartingn-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=c5f8a6754a7f9f657289e687cfbd096c&camp=1789&creative=9325) (we love these), 1L water bottle, and purchases within. And pack or buy a clutch for dinners on the town.

### Sexy Accessories

Don't forget to pack your lingerie. Most of mine are from [Agent Provocateur](https://shopstyle.it/l/b6gSO). 

I brought [Maison Margiela's REPLICA Mini Perfume Sampler Set](https://shopstyle.it/l/b6gIm), but Barcelona is a great place to buy a new fragrance.

Wear your jewelry, as Barcelona is a safe city, but, of course, keep it understated for smart travel.
